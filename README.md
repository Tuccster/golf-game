 A multiplayer golf game similar to Golf It!
 
# Premise
 *This is a rather old prototype of mine so the code isn't up to my current standards*

 This game was meant to be my own take on the mini golf videogame genre. Nothing too special about the game in its current state, although I did get multiplayer *mostly* working and the controls feel on par (get it?) with what you could expect from a game like this.

- *Note:  The game runs without lag, but the video here is at 24fps to lower the filesize enough to fit on here*
- *Note2: There is a bug in this version of the game where teleporting to a new hole maintains your velocity from the previous hole*
